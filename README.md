# SnowRunner-Auto-All-Unlock
An automatic tool (still in programming) that automatically unlocks vehicles and parts.

The user decompresses the preload\paks\client\initial.pak file of the game, and then puts the compiled program in the [media] folder and runs the program. 
The program will automatically traverse the xml files in each folder and its subfolders, detect keywords, and modify them.

In theory, this tool can be adapted to any upgrade or DLC etc.

Of course, this doesn't unlock unpurchased DLC, or items in the mod.


note: will kill all files if there're backup files before...
